# DemoSwingRatio

This application is a simple app to present material-ui-swing lib. In addition, the app is under developing (too slowly).

You can download the jar at this [link](https://gitlab.com/palazzovincenzo/demoswingratio/-/tree/master/bin)

## Results

After the first test with the demo Swing, I can conclude that is possible set the personal ratio at runtime with *complex* panels, like Mars use case [JMars](http://jmars.mars.asu.edu/)

_Waiting other tests_

At the moment the image generate with the demo are:
